        <h1><strong> Vermont State Police Traffic Stop Race Data </strong></h1>
        <p><strong> In 2010, the Vermont State Police began collecting race data on all their traffic stops.  Encompassing 6 years of traffic stop data, the visualization tools on this website can help us understand if and how race play into their decisions when dealing with motorists.</strong></p>

      <p><strong> This visualization shows that during the year-round consistently dark hours, minority drivers make up a larger percentage of the traffic stops.  One could conclude that minority drivers drive significantly more during those hours, working evening shifts.  One would have to consider that other side of that work commute would have to come within about 8 hours and within the daylight hours and that it would be more diffused, half before and half after.  As Vermont State Troopers watch cars drive past on the highway, frequently in excess of 65 miles an hour, it would be more difficult to recognize a driver’s race in the dark.  Does that mean that since Troopers started noting race on their traffic stops, they pull over more minorities when they can’t see the driver’s race and less when they can? -Team, does anyone had other thougths on this?</strong></p>
