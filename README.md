# VT-Police
Traffic Stop Data Analysis 


This was a project where we used Vermont State Police traffic stop race data from 2010-2015 as an exercise in using data visualizations.  This project involved coding in CSS, Java Script, Python, and HTML.

Below is a brief list of the README file's contents:
A. User Stories
B. Scrum Meeting Summaries
C. A burn-down chart
D. Sprint Retrospective


*****************************************************************************************
A.
User Stories for Viewers:
1
As a: police officer
I want: Easy to view data on racial disparities
So that:  I can better reflect on bias.

2
As a: member of the public
I want: data that can be understood
So that: my police are transparent and can be trusted.

3
As a: minority
I want: public evidence of disparities
So that: issues can be acknowledged and progress made.

User Stories for Class Stakeholders:

4
As a: Eric
I want: to use VT police traffic stop data
So that: I can better understand and analyze the realities of race and traffic stops.

5
As a: George
I want: to participate in this project
So that: I can learn to use the tools taught in this class.

6
As a: Aliya
I want: to present data fairly
So that: the information is not biased.

Scrum meeting on 1/17/17 at 09:30AM:

-Points accomplished since beginning:
136 points
-Points remaining:
342
-Next meeting is 1/19/17 at 09:30 hours
-discussed just getting data and trying to plug it into the visual to see how it comes out and maybe seeing if there is a visual that “plays nice” with the data. 
-discussed that tinkering with the visual can be a lot of time


BLOCKERS/ITEMS OF NOTE:
- George: schedule/traveling, hoping to lean on team members for basic questions
- Aliya: To work with Eric on correcting visualization, to create
- Eric: No blockers, busy after tomorrow.
- Nami: going to be working/on Slack tomorrow afternoon/all day.

HELPFUL TIPS AND REMINDERS:
- If you put your data in the format that your viz asks for and it doesn’t work, try a different viz.
- Adding front end tinkering as a card with 25 points.
- Pinned items are found in the channel’s menu by going to the split rectangle to the left of the search bar.
- Eric is available today for help!
- Let’s add notes about data set in general (time frame, number of rows, how was race determined, etc.)
- Let’s plan for Thursday morning at 9:30 AM EST for our next meeting and plan to have something to share in terms of a visualization.
- Let’s make a call about needing an extension by Friday at noon EST.

This document is editable, so add what you want post meeting.   

Scrum Meeting 1/19/17 at 09:30AM:

-Point accomplished since last meeting
108 (don’t think that is an accurate account of work done, though) Lot’s of debugging
-Points remaining:
-346 (but with de-bugging, we are in a much better place than last meeting)
-Next meeting: we will do a status check by end of 1/19/17

INDIVIDUAL NOTES:
Aliya: working on second example, working on viz narrative, blockers TBD
George: blocked by hectic schedule, unsure of where to start, but going to talk to Eric right after call.
Eric: been helping trying to debug, added narrative, crunched his dept’s data as he did the state
Nami: pulled together data and formatted it correctly, working to pull together viz today after shopping

NOTES:
- Front end will not use iframes, will link to different pages.
- Eric to write intro paragraph draft in GitHub.
- Nami to meet up with Eric after call.
- George to chat with Eric after call.
- Let’s all drop in a scrum update by EOD today, 11 PM EST. make a call about a deadline extension request by noon.


Scrum Meeting 1/19/17 at End of Day (due to schedules, this was a check-in via slack):


Eric: 
Hey team, I'm hitting the bed.  Regarding end of Thurs. check-in.  I made some changes to my page, I am happy with where it is.  Obviously we have some work to get Nami's back on.   Aliya has been crushing it with making the main page that calls the others.  Let's move our trellos over.

[1:27]  
Let's remember to make a "readme" which has an explanation of how we derived our data from the original.

Nami:
thanks @kratochvil! here is my update:

- from an aesthetic standpoint, just need to get my radial buttons back in the right spot (something happened, unclear what), center the chart + legend + radial buttons, and rename the column headers
- from a logistical perspective, need to pull my index.html out of my folder into the repo. going to do that, merge, and then got to bed for tonight

Aliya:
Regarding final checklist:
- Final Project Front-End Repo --> Done other than George's viz, debugging Nami's vis, Intro text, and other nice-to-haves
- Final Project Back-End Repo --> Would love someone to tackle this though I'm fine taking the hit to my grade if we land up leaving the csv files in the front end repo
- Trello Board (with team members assigned to tasks they did) --> This is effectively done though may need updating later today
- User Stories --> Eric could you put these into our README?
- Burn-down chart showing number of "points" accomplished between each scrum meeting --> We have this in Trello via color coding but not via a separate chart. Would love someone to make the chart (should not take long) but also comfortable taking the grade hit if we don't do this.
- Some kind of record of your scrum meetings --> Done
- A record of your sprint retrospective --> Thoughts on a Sunday AM retrospective? Don't think this will take long and happy to do it by Google Hangouts and use Trello or Slack as where we log our thoughts
- Link to your final project webpage on GitHub pages ---> Done - it is at: https://ekrat.github.io/VT-Police/index.html

[7:59]  
I'm going to do 1 or 2 more things on my visualization then will be offline likely till the evening. (both to clear my head and because I'm on a reservation and won't have internet till then). I will likely not have much time this evening but if there's anything urgent you need please let me know.

George:
To answer one question, a Sunday AM retrospective could work for me, but could we consider doing that via Slack? It sounds like a lot of people will be unavailable and it's not an ideal time for me either to try to do a call.

George Followup: 
Quick update from me: A number of unexpected things prevented me from working much on this yesterday, but I have much more time today and will be plugging away

Summary of Scrum Meeting:
Blockers:
Nami’s visualization has a bug when 
George is very busy and hectic
Aliya has limited internet access and has been doing tons of work trying to tie this together and sounds kind of overworked.


Points accomplished since last meeting: 135
Points remaining: 224

SPRINT RETRO:

*Start Doing:*
- create ideal timeline internal to sprint to help give more structure to the project
- make backlog on Trello more dynamic to reflect changing priorities and tasks as the project moves forward
- preempt code conflicts / expect complications
- using branches regularly and consistently
- alert folks if you identify a bug in their code and are going to jump into fix it
- establish Slack norms (ex. when to use private vs. public channels) at beginning of project

*Stop Doing:*
- not being in the same timezone/working on different schedules
- working on the master branch
- putting your JS, HTML, and CSS in the same file

*Continue Doing:*
- using Google Hangouts to interact face-to-face with team members
- using data that is meaningful to us and we have some expertise in to provide context
- helpfully taking a look at someone’s code and identifying issues
- leveraging people (like Dhrumil) to get help when you need help, vs. going down a rabbit hole
- being a good team and having an optimistic outlook
