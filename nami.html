    <h1><strong>How Race Affects Likelihood of Search</strong></h1>
    <h3><strong>Between 2010 and 2015, the Vermont State Police stopped upwards of 280,000 cars. The chart below shows the proportion of searches performed (in yellow), based on the race of the person stopped.</strong></h3>
    <h4>Those identified as Asian or Pacific Islanders are subject to searches the least -- .8% of the time they are stopped. Whites are searched 1.1% of the time, and Blacks are subjected almost five times as often (5.1% of stops result in searches). Those identified as Hispanic and as Native American are searched approximately 4% of the time.</h4>
