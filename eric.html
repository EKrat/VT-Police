	<h1><strong> How Time of Day Affects Racial Composition of Traffic Stops </strong></h1>
	<p><strong> Accessing six years of data, this visual shows the racial composition of traffic stops for each of the 24 hours in a day.  Each race is displayed as its proportion of all the traffics stops that hour.  One would hope for race to not factor into the decision to pull over a car.  What we see here is a noticeable increase of minority traffics stops during the hours that year-round would most difficult for officers to perceive driver race.</strong></p>
