    <h1><strong>Has the outcome of a traffic stop by race changed over the years?</strong></h1>
    <p><strong>This data shows the outcome of a traffic stop by race, specifically the percent of arrests by race. In other words, once an individual was pulled over, what percentage within their racial group was then arrested as the next step. You would hope that the rate of arrests would be the same within each racial group. What we see here is that while the rates of arrest have fluctuated over time, that there are still discrepancies.<strong></p>
